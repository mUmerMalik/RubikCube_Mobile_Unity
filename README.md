# Rubik's Cube in Unity



Feel free to use it as you like, however if you end up creating your own app basing it on my code, I would appreciate a lot if you linked this github repository and credited me in your app description :) 
Thanks!

## Features: 
 * Full Touch Support - Rotate cube around by touch the background and faces by touching the cube itself.
<br /> * Different Cube Sizes - Choose between easy 2x2x2, standard 3x3x3 or go crazy with 4x4x4.
